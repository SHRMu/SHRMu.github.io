# Java RMI Exception

- java.rmi.ConnectException

*Server exception: java.rmi.ConnectException: Connection refused to host: 10.0.75.1; nested exception is: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: connect*
	
pls wait seconds after starting rmiregistry, I prefer this exception means, the rmiregistry is not ready for server to connect
